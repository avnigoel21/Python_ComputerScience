input -> process -> output


processing -> CPU (Central Processing Unit) -> EXECUTING THE INSTRUCTIONS OF A COMPUTER PROGRAM

VON - NEUMANN ARCHITECTURE:
CPU COMPONENTS - 
ALU
Control unit: CONTROLS ALL THE OPERATIONS


Registers: STORES THE DATA
1) MAR -> MEMORY ADDRESS REGISTER
	-HOLDS THE MEMORY LOCATION OF DATA THAT NEEDS TO BE ACCESSED

2) MDR -> MEMORY DATA REGISTER
	-HOLDS DATA THAT IS BEING TRANSFERRED TO AOR FROM MEMORY

3) AC -> ACCUMULATOR
	-WHERE INTERMEDIATE AIRTHMETIC AND LOGIC UNITS ARE STORED

4) PC -> PROGRAM COUNTER
	-CONTAINS THE ADDRESS OF THE NEXT INSTRUCTION TO BE EXECUTED

A
BUSES -> ARE THE MEANS BY WHICH THE DATA IS TRANSMITTED FROM ONE PART OF A COMPUTER TO ANOTHER.
1) ADDRESS BUS
2) DATA BUS
3) CONTROL BUS

FETCH-DECODE-EXECUTE CYCLE:
FETCH -> FETCH THE NEXT INSTRUCTIONS FROM MAIN MEMORY, BRING IT BACK INTO THE CPU
DECODE -> INSPECT THE INSTRUCTION AND WORK OUT WHAT IT IS THAT NEEDS DOING
EXECUTE -> CARRY OUT THE INSTRUCTION IN ALU


HOW COMMON CHARACTERSTICKS OF CPU AFFECT THEIR PERFORMANCE:
1) CLOCK SPEED :* MEASURED IN HERTZ
		* NUMBER OF CYCLES PER SECOND
		* MODERN PROCESSORS OPERATE AT BILLIONS OF CYCLE PER SECOND
		* 3.2 GHZ CLOCK SPEED = 3.2 BILLION INSTRUCTIONS CAN BE FETCHED PER SECOND 

2) CACHE SIZE : * TEMPORARY STORAGE OF DATA AND INSTRUCTIONS BEING READ TO AND WRITTEN FROM THE RAM
		* STORES COPIES OF DATA AND INSTRUCTIONS
		* MUCH QUICKER GETTING ITEMS FROM THE CACHE FROM MAIN MEMORY

3) NUMBER OF CORES: * A CORE IS A COMPLETE COPY OF THE CPU
		    * DOUBLING THE NUMBER OF CORES DOESNOT SIMPLY DOUBLE THE OVERALL SPEED.
			CPU CORES HAVE TO COMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER, THIS TAKES TIME.
