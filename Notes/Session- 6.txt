TOPOLOGY: A GIVEN ARRANGEMENT OF ALL ELEMENTS THAT YOU NEED FOR NETWORKING

TYPES:
1) Bus Topology: Devices connected to a central backbone cable.
2) Ring Topology: Has the same potential as the bus network with main cable failure 
		  A second ring can be introduced to prevent this issue, but that requires extra cable

3) Star topology : most popular wired typed of network
		 : central switch
		 : all devices connect into the central switch
		 : the switch is intelligent and makes sure traffic only goes where it is intended.
	         : if a single cable breaks only that computer is effected
	         : the switch is however is still a serious point of failure.

4) Full Mesh Network Topology :
5) Partial Mesh Network Topology :
