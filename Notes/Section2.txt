Binary Numbers or binary Airthmetic

0,1

Representing characters:

ASCII Codes
(A, a, #, 0, !) etc

decimal values
A - 65
B - 66
C - 67
......


a - 97
b - 98
........


convert decimal values to binary
1) the divide by two method
2) the binary number line method


Representing images:
different ways of storing an image:
1) vector - the maths to store the square are stored (radius, color, width)  -> drawings
2) bitmap - images made up of different coloured squares, each square has binary value  -> photographs



Representing Sounds:
analog signal -> digital signal -> binary codes

sound waves: sample rate (speed)+ bit depth(detail)  


sample rate - how often you record the amplitude of a sound wave, the more often you record a sample the smoother the playback will sound.
bit depth - represents how many different gradations of amplitude can be represented in a digital wave form.


Compression:
1) lossy copression - we loss the quality of the images
2) lossless compression: this method does not loss any data at all during compression.
