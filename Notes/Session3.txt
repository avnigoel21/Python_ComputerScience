Networking

Advantages:
1) Users can access their files from any computer on the network
2) Servers can control security, backup of data, software updates
3) Communication with other people through email or social networking

LAN (Local area network)
1) covers a small area located in a single site.
2) LANS are wired with UTP Cable, fibre optic or wireless using wifi
3) All the hardware for a LAN is owned by the organization using it.

WAN (Wide Area Network)
1) Covers a large area connecting LANs together
2) WANS are connected with telephone lines, fibre optics cables or satellite links
3) Infrastructure between the LANs is leased from telecommunication companies who owns and manages it.


Disadvatages of Networking
1) Increased security risk of data
2) Malware and viruses spread very easity between computers
3) The computer may run more slowly if there is a lot of datatravelling on the network
4) if a server fails, the computers connected to it may not work

Factors that affect the performance of networks:
1) Bandwidth - the amount of data that can be sent and recieved successfully in a given time.
	     - this is not a measure of how fast data travels, but how much data can be sent on the transmission media
             - Measured in bits per second often called bit rate.
2) The numeber of users - too many users or devices on the same network can cause the network slwo down if there is insufficent bandwidth for the data
3) Transmission media - Wired connections have a higher bandwidth than wireless connections
		      - fibre optic cables have a bandwidth than copper cables.
4) error rate - less reliable connections increase the number of errors taht occur when data is tranferred.
	      - The signal quality of wireless connections is dependent on the range of devices from the wireless access point and other environmental factors
	      - The signal quality of copper cables is determined by the grade of material used reduces interference.
	      - The length of the cable is also a factor
5) Latency - The delay from transmitting data to recieving it
	   - caused by bottlenecks in the infrastructure of the network
	   - eg - by not using switches to appropriately segment traffic on a network
	   - Hardware such as switches and transmission media may not operate at the same speed



Client-Server Model
1) A server controls access and security to one shared file store.
2) A server manages access to the internet
3) A server runs a backup of data
4) A server manages the printing jobs
5) A server provides email services
6) A client makes request to the server for data and connections

Advantages of Client-Server Model: 
1)Easier to manage security files
2)Easier to take backups of all the shared data
3)Easier to install software updates to all computers

Disadvantages of Client-Server Model:
1)The server is a single point of failure
2)Can be expensive to setup and maintain
3)Requires IT Specialists to maintain
4)Users will lose access if the server fails



Peer to Peer model

A peer is a computer on a network and is equal to all other peers
Peers serve their own files to each other
Each peer is responsible for its own security and backup

Advantages: 
1) very easy to maintain 
2) No dependency on a single computer
3) cheaper to set up
4) no expensive hardwares required
5) specialist staff are not required

Disadvantages:
1) The network is less secure
2) Users will need to manage their own backup
